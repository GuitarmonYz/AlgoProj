# README

This is a algorithm group project for solving Minium Vertex Cover problem.

**Four Algorithms implemented**

- Construction Heuristics with approximation guarantees.
- Exact algorithm using Branch-and-Bound.
- Local Search: Hill Climbing Algorithm.
- Local Search2

**reference book:**

using intelliJ, build a MVC.jar based on Launcher as main class
output the jar file under AlgoProj folder
Run: java -jar MVC.jar -inst jazz.graph -alg LS1 -time 600 -seed 1


In the launcher, the order of argument is not fixed
The argument of inst alg time is must, seed is optional.
